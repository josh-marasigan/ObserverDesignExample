## Dependencies
This sample app does require SnapKit for auto layout. So please install via cocoapod prior to building.

If you don't have cocoapods, run the following:
`sudo gem install cocoapods`

Then, change to the current project directory:
`cd <YOUR PATH TO THE PROJECT DIRECTORY>/observer-example`
(If you are unsure of where the directory is, look for the directory in which the Podfile resides and this is where you'll want to be)

Lastly run:
`pod install`
